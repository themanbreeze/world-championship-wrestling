### Notes :

**Creative Goal**

Deliver an era-authentic wrestling experience with versatile roster interchangeability. Enable the creation of different tag teams and stable variations, such as the Four Horsemen, Dangerous Alliance, or the Fabulous Freebirds, to accurately recreate historical events and match scenarios from the 1990–1992 WCW/NWA period.

**Williams/Gordy in the AJPW Stable**

Steve Williams and Terry Gordy were WCW Tag Team Champions during this era and were initially placed in Group 4. They were reassigned to the AJPW stable, which highlights wrestlers with 1980s NWA crossover, to maintain balance among stable sizes.

**Andre The Giant**

In the early 1990s, Andre The Giant was near the end of his career and made only occasional guest appearances in WCW, while competing in approximately 90 matches for AJPW. As this ROM hack is inspired by the 1990 NES game World Championship Wrestling, Andre’s likeness serves as the in-game “WCW Master” boss character.

**Bam Bam Bigelow**

Similar to his NJPW stablemates, Bam Bam Bigelow participated in several Super Shows. He also maintained a long-standing tag team partnership with Big Van Vader, reflecting his prominence in both WCW and Japanese wrestling during this period.

**The Shockmaster and other Jobbers**

While joke gimmicks and jobbers have their appeal, this project emphasizes wrestling performance and historical accuracy. After reviewing career data on cagematch.net, consulting old WCW Magazine scans, and watching archival programming, the current roster represents the snapshot I find most accurate and balanced for the 1990–1992 era.

**Where is __________?**

Decisions regarding certain wrestlers involve multiple factors. For instance, including Davey Boy Smith and Lord Steven Regal might necessitate adding Harlem Heat to maintain balance. Conversely, prioritizing era authenticity may require relocating "Flying Scorpio" to the NJPW stable and adjusting other placements. Women were omitted due to the need to preserve wrestler slots for the core roster.
